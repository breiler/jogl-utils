    <title>The Minimal Scene Graph (MSG)</title>

<p>
    The Minimal Scene Graph (MSG) is a small, lightweight 3D scene graph
    library layered on top of the <a href="https://jogamp.org/jogl/">Java OpenGL API</a> (JOGL).
    MSG is heavily inspired by the Open Inventor(tm) library developed by
    Silicon Graphics, Inc. and derives most of its concepts and internal structure from this library,
    which was released in open-source form in 2000. Many implementation
    decisions were informed by studying the Open Inventor source code.
</p>
<p>
    MSG is more free-form in style than many contemporary scene graphs.
    The traversal order of the scene graph is significant, and occurs in
    top-down, left-to-right order. Nodes placed in the scene graph affect
    the global state when they are traversed. When geometry is rendered,
    it acquires its visual characteristics from the current settings in
    the global state. Actions are applied to nodes to cause operations
    such as rendering.
</p>
<p>
    Group nodes collect children nodes underneath them, but have no effect
    on the global state, which propagates both upward and downward through
    them. Separator nodes, which are a subclass of Group, prevent state
    changes underneath them from propagating out and affecting nodes which
    follow them in the graph. This allows them to be used as an effective
    means of collecting reusable pieces of scene graph structure. Global
    state propagates downward through Separators.
</p>
<p>
    The current set of nodes is minimal (as indicated by the name of the
    library) and the current set of actions is incomplete.
</p>
<p>
    This library is based on <a href="https://https://github.com/sgothel/jogl-utils/">jogl-utils</a> but has been
    streamlined to only include the scene graph components.
